OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection Model) - It s a conceptual framework that standardizes how different networking systems communicate over a network. 
OSI Model includes 7 layers, each with specific functions.

7 Layers of the OSI Model

Layer Name	                              Description

1. Application Layer	                        Closest to the user. Provides services like web browsers, email, FTP. It interacts with software applications.
2. Presentation Layer	                       Translates data between application and network (e.g., encryption, compression, encoding like JPEG, ASCII).
3. Session Layer	                            Manages sessions or connections between computers (e.g., opening, managing, and closing sessions).
4. Transport Layer	                          Ensures reliable data transfer (e.g., TCP for reliability, UDP for speed). Handles error recovery and flow control.
5. Network Layer	                            Routes packets between different networks using IP addresses. (e.g., Routers, IP protocol).
6. Data Link Layer	                          Handles communication between devices on the same network. Uses MAC addresses. (e.g., Switches, Ethernet).
7. Physical Layer	                           Deals with physical transmission of raw bits (0s and 1s) over hardware like cables, switches, NICs.

Example of Data Flow for sending mail

Application – You write the email.
Presentation – The message is encrypted.
Session – A session is opened between your device and the mail server.
Transport – The email is split into packets with TCP.
Network – Each packet gets the IP address of the destination.
Data Link – Packets are framed and given MAC addresses.
Physical – Bits are transmitted over cables.


TCP/IP model (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) - It is the foundational communication model used for the Internet and modern networks. 
 It defines how data is sent and received between systems over networks. TCS/IP model includes 4 layesr

4 Layers of TCP/IP Model

TCP/IP Layer       Description
   
1. Application        Supports application services like HTTP, FTP, DNS, SMTP, etc.
2. Transport          Manages end-to-end communication, error handling (TCP, UDP).
3. Internet           Responsible for logical addressing and routing (IP, ICMP).
4. Network Access     Deals with physical transmission and hardware (MAC, Ethernet).

TCP/IP Protocols Examples by Layer

Application Layer: HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, DNS, SNMP
Transport Layer: TCP, UDP
Internet Layer: IP, ICMP, ARP
Network Access Layer: Ethernet, Wi-Fi, MAC

Differences between OSI and TCP/IP model

OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection)                                                                    TCP/IP Model (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)

Developed By	ISO (International Organization for Standardization)                                            Developed By U.S. Department of Defense (DoD)
OSI model includes 7 Layers                                                                                  TCP/IP model includes 4 layers      
Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data Link, Physical layers                           Application, Transport, Internet, Network Access layers
Theoretical model used for teaching and design                                                               Practical model used for real-world networking
Protocol-independent                                                                                         Based on TCP/IP protocols
More detailed, but more complex                                                                              Simpler and faster for implementation
Offers detailed error checking in layers                                                                     Relies on core protocols (like TCP) for reliability
